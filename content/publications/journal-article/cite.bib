	abstract = {Future socioeconomic climate pathways have regional water-quality consequences whose severity and equity have not yet been fully understood across geographic and economic spectra. We use a process-based, terrestrial-freshwater ecosystem model to project 21st-century river nitrogen loads under these pathways. We find that fertilizer usage is the primary determinant of future river nitrogen loads, changing precipitation and warming have limited impacts, and CO2 fertilization-induced vegetation growth enhancement leads to modest load reductions. Fertilizer applications to produce bioenergy in climate mitigation scenarios cause larger load increases than in the highest emission scenario. Loads generally increase in low-income regions, yet remain stable or decrease in high-income regions where agricultural advances, low food and feed production and waste, and/or well-enforced air pollution policies balance biofuel-associated fertilizer burdens. Consideration of biofuel production options with low fertilizer demand and rapid transfer of agricultural advances from high- to low-income regions may help avoid inequitable water-quality outcomes from climate mitigation.},

	title = {Future trends of agricultural ammonia global emissions in a changing climate},
	abstract = {Because of the growth of the human population, global livestock is projected to increase through the end of the century, with possible impacts on air quality and climate through ammonia emissions. In this study, we provide future global {NH}3 emissions from agriculture by 2100 and propose a methodology to reconstruct global gridded livestock densities for the future. Based on future regional livestock production and constrained by grassland distribution evolution, future livestock distribution for three Shared Socio-economic Pathways ({SSP}2-4.5, {SSP}4-3.4, and {SSP}5-8.5) have been reconstructed and used in the {CAMEO} model to estimate the resulting {NH}3 emissions by 2100. In some areas situated in Africa, livestock densities will be notably expanded in 2100 compared to the historical period (×40) and contribute to the most significant regional budget worldwide ranging from 10 to 16 {TgN}.yr−1. In addition, to reply to livestock density changes, {CAMEO} is also able to capture the future variations of meteorological variables and [{CO}2] which reflects an increase in the emissions and accounts for 15 to 20\% of the total emissions. Our future emissions compare well with the range estimated in Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project ({CMIP}6), but some differences arise within the {SSPs}.},

	abstract = {Ammonia ({NH}3) is an important atmospheric constituent. It plays a role in air quality and climate through the formation of ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate particles. It has also an impact on ecosystems through deposition processes. About 85 \% of {NH}3 global anthropogenic emissions are related to food and feed production and, in particular, to the use of mineral fertilizers and manure management. Most global chemistry transport models ({CTMs}) rely on bottom-up emission inventories, which are subject to significant uncertainties. In this study, we estimate emissions from livestock by developing a new module to calculate ammonia emissions from the whole agricultural sector (from housing and storage to grazing and fertilizer application) within the {ORCHIDEE} (Organising Carbon and Hydrology In Dynamic Ecosystems) global land surface model. We detail the approach used for quantifying livestock feed management, manure application, and indoor and soil emissions and subsequently evaluate the model performance. Our results reflect China, India, Africa, Latin America, the {USA}, and Europe as the main contributors to global {NH}3 emissions, accounting for 80 \% of the total budget. The global calculated emissions reach 44 Tg N yr−1 over the 2005–2015 period, which is within the range estimated by previous work. Key parameters (e.g., the {pH} of the manure, timing of N application, and atmospheric {NH}3 surface concentration) that drive the soil emissions have also been tested in order to assess the sensitivity of our model. Manure {pH} is the parameter to which modeled emissions are the most sensitive, with a 10 \% change in emissions per percent change in {pH}. Even though we found an underestimation in our emissions over Europe (−26 \%) and an overestimation in the {USA} (+56 \%) compared with previous work, other hot spot regions are consistent. The calculated emission seasonality is in very good agreement with satellite-based emissions. These encouraging results prove the potential of coupling {ORCHIDEE} land-based emissions to {CTMs}, which are currently forced by bottom-up anthropogenic-centered inventories such as the {CEDS} (Community Emissions Data System).},
