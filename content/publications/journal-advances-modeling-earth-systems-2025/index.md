abstract: "Due to the growing global population and increased livestock farming, emissions of ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) are expected to rise until the end of the century with possible impacts on air quality and climate. This study introduces a method to predict livestock densities and NH<sub>3</sub> emissions worldwide until 2100. We estimate future livestock distribution based on different socio-economic scenarios and use a modeling approach to quantify resulting emissions. The predicted global NH<sub>3</sub> emissions align well with estimates from a major climate modeling project, but there are variations within the scenarios studied. By 2100, global ammonia emissions may increase by 30%–50%, reaching 50 to 70 Tg NH<sub>3</sub> yr<sup>−1</sup>, with Africa becoming one of the most important emitter regions. Due to their sensitivity to environmental conditions, NH<sub>3</sub> emissions are expected to be enhanced by climate change whose contribution can reach 20%. The data generated in this study provides an alternative to traditional emission projections which usually overlook climate sensitivity. This aims to help for a better understanding of future air pollution and its interactions with climate."
