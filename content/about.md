      title: 'Reviewer Experience'
      text: |-
        I serve as a reviewer for the following journals:
        
        - **Environmental Science & Technology**
        - **Geophysical Research Letters**
        - **Agricultural and Forest Meteorology**
        - **Geoscientific Model Development**
        - **IEEE JSTARS**
        
        I am committed to maintaining the highest standards of scientific peer review and contributing to the advancement of environmental and atmospheric sciences.

        ## Member of "Agromigrateur" Association (2017)
        
        I was actively involved in conversation sessions in French with Afghan refugees, helping them integrate into French society through language practice and cultural exchange.
        
        ## Ecovolunteer Experiences (2016)
        
        I participated in development of agroecology in local communities across:
        
        - **Kenya** - Working with local farmers on sustainable agricultural practices
        - **Ecuador** - Supporting community-based agroecological initiatives  
        - **Galapagos Islands** - Contributing to conservation and sustainable development projects
        
        These experiences deepened my understanding of the connections between agricultural practices, environmental sustainability, and community development, which continues to inform my research on global agricultural systems and their environmental impacts.

      title: 'Research Philosophy'
      text: |-
        My research is driven by the urgent need to understand and address the complex interactions between human activities and Earth's biogeochemical cycles. I believe that comprehensive Earth System Models are essential tools for predicting future environmental changes and informing policy decisions.
        
        Through my work on nitrogen cycle modeling, I aim to:
        
        - **Advance scientific understanding** of microbial-plant-soil interactions
        - **Improve model representations** of biogeochemical processes
        - **Bridge scales** from local agricultural practices to global climate impacts
        - **Support evidence-based policy** for sustainable agriculture and climate mitigation
        
        I am committed to open science practices and believe in the importance of making research accessible to both the scientific community and the broader public.
